* consult-fasd
[[https://github.com/clvv/fasd][Fasd]] integration for =consult=. Basically [[https://github.com/ajsalminen/helm-fasd][helm-fasd]] alternative for helm-less configuration with some improvement.

The query can be filtered first by fasd then a second time by consult the same ways as =consult-grep=.

For example: =#Dow#cons= may find the =consult.el= file in =Downloads= directory.
* Install
It's generally advised to also install =fasd= package from =melpa= to keep =fasd= cache up to date with Emacs, but it's not required.

The package provide an interactive function =consult-fasd= that should be binded to a key (or can be used directly with =M-x=.)
